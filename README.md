# Deprecation warning
We suggest to use the following experiment instead: https://github.com/UiL-OTS-labs/jspsych-spr-mw
This experiment will not receive any future updates and is marked as READONLY.

# jspsych-self-paced-reading-mw
Self-paced reading with moving window implementation, programmed in jsPsych (JavaScript)

# How to use
See instruction and some more context at https://github.com/UiL-OTS-labs/jspsych-vislexdec-vp , also for setting up a version with your own folder.

In the current development case and stage, the script paths point directly to our own paths for the current development version, so if you have a working internet connection, locally double clicking on the file index.html should start the boilerplate/template in your default browser.

# Todo
- The conditional workflow given incidence of check questions/statements
- Better layouting and such
- Docs (as soon as more generic)
